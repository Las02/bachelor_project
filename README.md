# Analysis of rRNA multiplicity and diversity
### Aim
The aim of this project is to establish correlations between the variability and abundance of 16S rRNA genes and ecological factors. This will be done through data-mining both databases and bacterial genomes for 16s rRNA gene information and ecological information.  This information will then be used to build several statistical models that can explain the variation in the 16S gene copy number and the intragenomic diversity between them.

### Folders
The files for the project is structured into two different main folders. Firstly, the folder "DataPreparation", which contains the files for gathering the data used for the project. Secondly, the folder "DataAnalysis" which contains the files for the dataanalysis in addition to files for preparing the data for modelling. A more in depht overview of the files can be found in the "README"s in the above mentioned folders.

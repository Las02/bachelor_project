# Analysis of rRNA multiplicity and diversity
### Aim
The aim of this project is to establish correlations between the sequence diversity and copy 
number multiplicity of the 16S rRNA genes and bacterial traits and environmental factors. 
This will be done through data-mining both databases and bacterial genomes for 16S rRNA 
gene information and information about bacterias’ traits and the environment they live in. 
This information will then be used to build several statistical models that can explain the 16S 
rRNA gene’s variation in both copy number and degree of intragenomic sequence diversity.

### Folders
The files for the project is structured into 3 different main folders. Firstly, the folder "DataPreparation", which contains the files for gathering the data used for the project. Secondly, the folder "DataAnalysis" which contains the files for the dataanalysis in addition to files for preparing the data for modelling. Thirdly, the folder AntibioticResistance which contains the files for gathering information about antibiotic resistance mechanisms. A more in depht overview of the files can be found in the "README"s in the above mentioned folders.
